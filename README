This contains configurations for easily adding dexterity support to Plone 4.

It should be possible to download the dexterity-plone4.0.5.cfg file to your buildout directory 
then add the following to the extends section of your buildout.cfg

extends =
         ....
         dexterity-plone4.0.5.cfg

then rerun buildout, typically:

  bin/buildout


This will add the relevant dependencies to your buildout.
