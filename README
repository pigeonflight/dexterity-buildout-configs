WARNING!! still working on this, doesn't behave as expected yet, need to do a bit more work on the buildout

This contains configurations for easily adding dexterity support to Plone 4.

It should be possible to download the dexterity-plone4.0.5.cfg file to your buildout directory 
then add the following to the extends section of your buildout.cfg

extends =
         ....
         dexterity-plone4.0.5.cfg

then rerun buildout, typically:

  bin/buildout

This will add the relevant dependencies to your buildout (add the -n option if in doubt).

  bin/buildout -n

I've also included a good starting point for a dexterity product based on Martin Aspeli's tutorial 
on the Plone.org site: http://plone.org/products/dexterity/documentation/manual/developer-manual

To include the example.conference add the example.conference.cfg file and update your
buildout appropriately.

extends =
          ....
         dexterity-plone4.0.5.cfg
         example.conference.cfg

       
then rerun buildout

    bin/buildout

(note, you'll need to have git installed on your system).
